# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: New Rust version (2025-06-07)
I just created a new version in Rust, check it out here: [upv-cli](https://github.com/algono/upv-cli).

The new version is currently way faster, x60 smaller (from ~60 MB -in a self-contained binary- to just under 1 MB!) and contains the main functionality, with slight differences and improvements, especially in terms of additional commands and error handling/messaging.

This .NET version is just a direct port of the main VPN and drive functionalities from [AccesoUPV](https://github.com/algono/AccesoUPV).
